## 📊 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes and predicts housing price trends across 5 major Canadian cities using machine learning models. We achieved **R² score of 0.925** using historical price data and interest rates.

The analysis covers:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Baseline and advanced predictive models
- City-specific analysis & investment insights
- Visual storytelling for decision support

### **Objectives:**

1. Analyze 20 years of Canadian housing market data (2005-2025)
2. Identify key factors influencing price changes
3. Build predictive models for monthly price forecasting
4. Compare city-specific market dynamics and predictability
5. Provide short-term market direction forecasts per city
6. Create interactive dashboard for stakeholder use

### **Data Sources:**

- **Housing Prices**

  - MLS Home Price Index (via Statistics Canada)
  - Monthly data by city and house type
  - Cities: Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Montreal

- **Interest Rates**
  - Bank of Canada
  - Daily rates aggregated to monthly level

## 📊 **Key Results**

### **Model Performance:**

| Model                 | R²        | RMSE  | MAPE  | Status      |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Linear Regression** | **0.925** | 0.252 | 51.9% | ✅ **Best** |
| Random Forest         | 0.906     | 0.282 | 89.2% | Good        |
| XGBoost               | 0.908     | 0.278 | 80.7% | Good        |

**Winner:** Linear Regression (92.5% accuracy)  
**Note:** MAPE is inflated due to low baseline prices in early years (2005–2007).

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Past prices are strongest predictors**

   - Previous month's index: 52% feature importance
   - 3-month moving average: 18% importance

2. **Interest rates have moderate impact**

   - 5-year mortgage rate: 8% importance
   - Lag effect of 3-6 months observed

3. **City-specific patterns:**

   - **Most predictable:** Calgary (lowest volatility)
   - **Most volatile:** Toronto (highest price swings)
   - **Highest growth:** Toronto (+305.9% since 2005)

4. **Major events impact:**
   - 2008 Financial Crisis: All cities declined
   - COVID-19 (2020-2021): Synchronized 20-30% growth
   - Rate Hikes (2022-2023): Sharp corrections

## 🏙️ **City-Specific Analysis**

Each city has unique market dynamics. We trained separate Random Forest models per city to measure individual predictability and volatility.

### **City Performance Heatmap** (`11_city_performance_heatmap.png`)

Compares R², RMSE, MAE, and volatility (σ) across all 5 cities side by side.

### **Key City Insights:**

| City      | Volatility (σ) | Characteristics                          |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Calgary   | Lowest         | Most stable, most predictable            |
| Montreal  | Low-Medium     | Steady growth, consistent                |
| Ottawa    | Medium         | Balanced market                          |
| Vancouver | Medium-High    | Strong fundamentals, high growth         |
| Toronto   | Highest        | Maximum growth (+305.9%) but most risky  |

## 📈 **Market Forecast & Investment Insights**

### **Short-Term Forecast** (`12_price_trends_forecast.png`)

Using the combined RF + XGBoost prediction on the most recent data point, we project the **3-month price direction** for each city. Green arrow = rising, Red arrow = falling.

> ⚠️ This is a short-term directional forecast only (3–6 months). It is based on historical patterns and should not be used as financial advice.

### **City Investment Score** (`13_city_value_comparison.png`)

We ranked cities using a composite score:
- **40%** — Average monthly growth rate
- **30%** — Stability (lower volatility = better)
- **30%** — Predictability (R² score)

The bubble chart shows Growth vs Volatility, where bubble size represents model predictability. Use this to understand the risk/reward tradeoff per city.

## 🔬 **Methodology**

### **Data Sources:**

- **MLS Home Price Index (via Statistics Canada):** Statistics Canada (2005-2025)
- **Interest Rates:** Bank of Canada (2005-2025)

### **Feature Engineering**

Time-series–specific features were engineered to capture housing market dynamics:

- Lag features (1, 3, 12 months) to model temporal dependency
- Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage changes
- Rolling averages (3-month, 12-month) to smooth short- and long-term trends
- Derived momentum features measuring distance from moving averages

All features were generated after sorting the data by date to preserve temporal integrity.
The resulting dataset was saved as `housing_data_with_features.csv` for reproducibility.

### **Models Developed:**

1. **Linear Regression** (Baseline)
2. **Random Forest** (100 trees, depth 15)
3. **XGBoost** (100 estimators, lr 0.1)
4. **City-Specific Random Forest** (separate model per city)

### **Evaluation Metrics:**

- **R²** (variance explained)
- **RMSE** (root mean squared error)
- **MAE** (mean absolute error)
- **MAPE** (mean absolute percentage error)
