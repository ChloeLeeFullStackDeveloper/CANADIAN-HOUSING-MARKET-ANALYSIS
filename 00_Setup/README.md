## 📊 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes and predicts housing price trends across 5 major Canadian cities using machine learning models. We achieved **R² score of 0.925** using historical price data and interest rates.

The analysis covers:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Baseline and advanced predictive models
- Visual storytelling for decision support

### **Objectives:**

1. Analyze 20 years of Canadian housing market data (2005-2025)
2. Identify key factors influencing price changes
3. Build predictive models for monthly price forecasting
4. Create interactive dashboard for stakeholder use

### **Data Sources:**

- **Housing Prices**

  - MLS Home Price Index (via Statistics Canada)
  - Monthly data by city and house type
  - Cities: Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Ottawa, Montreal

- **Interest Rates**
  - Bank of Canada

## 📊 **Key Results**

### **Model Performance:**

| Model                 | R²        | RMSE  | MAPE  | Status      |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| **Linear Regression** | **0.925** | 0.252 | 51.9% | ✅ **Best** |
| Random Forest         | 0.906     | 0.282 | 89.2% | Good        |
| XGBoost               | 0.908     | 0.278 | 80.7% | Good        |

**Winner:** Linear Regression (92.5% accuracy)  
**Note:** MAPE is inflated due to low baseline prices in early years (2005–2007).

### **Key Findings:**

1. **Past prices are strongest predictors**

   - Previous month's index: 52% feature importance
   - 3-month moving average: 18% importance

2. **Interest rates have moderate impact**

   - 5-year mortgage rate: 8% importance
   - Lag effect of 3-6 months observed

3. **City-specific patterns:**

   - **Most predictable:** Calgary (lowest volatility)
   - **Most volatile:** Toronto (highest price swings)
   - **Highest growth:** Toronto (+305.9% since 2005)

4. **Major events impact:**
   - 2008 Financial Crisis: All cities declined
   - COVID-19 (2020-2021): Synchronized 20-30% growth
   - Rate Hikes (2022-2023): Sharp corrections

## 🔬 **Methodology**

### **Data Sources:**

- **MLS Home Price Index (via Statistics Canada):** Statistics Canada (2005-2025)
- **Interest Rates:** Bank of Canada (2005-2025)

### Feature Engineering

Time-series–specific features were engineered to capture housing market dynamics:

- Lag features (1, 3, 12 months) to model temporal dependency
- Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) percentage changes
- Rolling averages (3-month, 12-month) to smooth short- and long-term trends
- Derived momentum features measuring distance from moving averages

All features were generated after sorting the data by date to preserve temporal integrity.
The resulting dataset was saved as housing_data_with_features.csv for reproducibility.

### **Models Developed:**

1. **Linear Regression** (Baseline)
2. **Random Forest** (100 trees, depth 15)
3. **XGBoost** (100 estimators, lr 0.1)

### **Evaluation Metrics:**

- **R²** (variance explained)
- **RMSE** (root mean squared error)
- **MAE** (mean absolute error)
- **MAPE** (mean absolute percentage error)

This kernel ensures consistent package versions across environments.
All notebooks in this project were developed and tested using the following kernel:

- **Kernel:** `Python (Housing)`

When opening a notebook in Jupyter, please select this kernel if prompted.

If you see a kernel selection dialog:

1. Choose **Python (Housing)**
2. Click **Select**
